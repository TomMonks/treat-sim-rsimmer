abstract: | 
  The materials and methods in this documentation support work towards developing the **S.T.A.R.S healthcare framework** (**S**haring **T**ools and **A**rtifacts for **R**eproducible **S**imulations in healthcare).  Long term S.T.A.R.S aims to support researchers share open simulation models regardless of language choice, improve the quality of sharing, and reduce the workload required to meet high standards of open science for the modelling and simulation community.

  The code and written materials are a **work in progress** towards STARS version 2.0. It demonstrates the application od sharing a discrete-event simuilation model and associated research artifacts:  
  
  * All artifacts in this repository are linked to study researchers via ORCIDs;
  * Model code is made available under the MIT license;
  * [**To do**: validate and test R dependencies managed through `renv`]
  *  The R code and simmer model are documented and explained in a quarto website served up by GitHub pages;
  * [**To do**: the materials are deposited and made citatable using Zenodo;]
  * [**To do**: The models are sharable with other researchers and the NHS without the need to install software.]
